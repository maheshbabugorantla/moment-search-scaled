"""Ingest worker entrypoint — serves the Prefect flow.

    python -m src.worker

flow.serve() registers the "ms-ingest-video/ingest" deployment in Prefect Cloud
(idempotent) and long-polls for scheduled runs — outbound HTTPS only, no
ports. Scale horizontally by running more replicas of this process; each
executes up to WORKER_CONCURRENCY runs at once.

Sample seeding is NOT done here — it's a one-shot startup gate (seed.py /
src/seeding.py) that the whole stack waits on, so the app never serves a
half-indexed corpus. This worker only handles user uploads + YouTube adds.

Embedding goes to the warm CLIP service when CLIP_SERVICE_URL is set
(docker-compose default); unset, each run loads the model in-process.
